## Overview
The geo Demo was very helpful, we got kinda confused but Mr. Ghandy helped us with his inner peace. we refactored the code to a more orginized way, and tried to add the Eventful method. 

## Getting Started
we followed the demo, and the demo video.

## Architecture
we used JavaScript and Node.js. we orginized our work using Trello. 

## Change Log
1. we faced the duplication problem and we solved it by emptying the array.
2. we had the hours show because we used the toString method but we changed it ti toDateString method to get the desired output.
3. enhanced the respond messages. (sorry about the last messages, but me and my partner had Joker vibes hahaha).
4. refactored the code based on the instructor's logic.
